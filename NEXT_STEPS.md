# True North Receivables Group – Website Roadmap

This document tracks planned enhancements for www.truenorthreceivables.com

---

## ✅ Current State (Launch Phase)
- Single-page site hosted on GitHub Pages
- Clean professional layout with branding and logo
- Public compliance document links
- Custom domain: `truenorthreceivables.com`
- Email: `contact@truenorthreceivables.com`
- Favicon uploaded (see note below)

## 🔧 To Fix

---

## 🔜 Future Page Ideas

### 📄 Multi-Page Layout
- `/about` – Team background, mission, and company overview
- `/services` – Portfolio acquisition, compliance monitoring, vendor oversight
- `/compliance` – Public access to FDCPA policy, privacy policy, license list
- `/contact` – With inquiry form, map, and hours
- `/vendor-portal` – (Private login later) document access for agencies

---

## ⚙️ Additional Features
- Responsive mobile navigation
- Analytics (e.g. Plausible, Fathom)
- Custom 404 page
- Hosting alternatives (e.g., Netlify with SSL/CDN)
- Embedded intake/dispute forms
- Enhanced SEO metadata per page

---

## 📁 Internal TODOs
- Organize site structure into folders: `assets/`, `pdf/`, `images/`
